# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Overview
This sub-room introduces the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its role in cyber defense. It explains how ATT&CK categorizes adversary behavior based on real-world attack techniques and how SOC teams use it for detection and analysis.

**Path:** SOC Level 1  

**Focus Area:** Threat Frameworks, Adversary Tactics and Techniques



## What Was Covered
- Purpose of the MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Structure of tactics and techniques
- Mapping attacker behavior to ATT&CK
- Use of ATT&CK in SOC operations



## Key Concepts
- **Tactics** represent attacker goals (the “why”)
- **Techniques** describe how attackers achieve those goals
- **Sub-techniques** provide deeper technical detail
- Framework is based on real-world threat data



## Key Points
- MITRE ATT&CK improves threat understanding
- SOC analysts use ATT&CK for detection mapping
- Helps standardize communication across teams
- Supports threat hunting and incident response



## Screenshots
Supporting screenshots for this sub-room are stored in the [screenshots](screenshots) directory.



## Takeaways
Understanding MITRE ATT&CK helps a Junior SOC Analyst:
- Identify attacker behavior during investigations
- Map alerts to known techniques
- Improve detection and response accuracy
