# Unified Kill Chain

## Overview
This sub-room introduces the Unified Kill Chain framework and explains how it combines multiple attack lifecycle models into a single, comprehensive view. It helps SOC teams understand attacker behavior from initial access to objectives.

**Path:** SOC Level 1  
 
**Focus Area:** Attack Lifecycle, Defensive Strategy



## What Was Covered
- Purpose of the Unified Kill Chain
- Combining multiple attack models
- Understanding end-to-end attacker behavior
- Applying the framework in SOC operations



## Key Concepts
- Visibility across the full attack lifecycle
- Mapping attacker actions to defense controls
- Identifying detection and response opportunities
- Improving incident analysis and response



## Key Points
- The Unified Kill Chain provides a holistic attack view
- Helps identify gaps in detection coverage
- Supports better incident response planning
- Complements other frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK

## Takeaways
Understanding the Unified Kill Chain helps a Junior SOC Analyst:
- Analyze attacks from start to finish
- Identify where defenses failed or succeeded
- Improve detection and response strategies
