# Pyramid of Pain

## Overview
This sub-room introduces the Pyramid of Pain model and its role in cyber defense. It explains how different types of indicators affect attackers and why some detections are more impactful than others.

**Path:** SOC Level 1  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Focus Area:** Threat Intelligence, Detection Strategy

---

## What Was Covered
- Purpose of the Pyramid of Pain
- Different types of indicators
- Impact of detections on adversaries
- Prioritizing high-value indicators

---

## Pyramid Levels
From lowest to highest impact:
- Hash Values
- IP Addresses
- Domain Names
- Network / Host Artifacts
- Tools
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

---

## Key Points
- Low-level indicators are easy for attackers to change
- Higher-level indicators are harder to evade
- TTP-based detections cause the most “pain” to attackers
- SOC teams should prioritize durable detections
