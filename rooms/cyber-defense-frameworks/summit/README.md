# SUMMIT Framework

## Overview
This sub-room introduces the SUMMIT framework and its role in cyber defense. It focuses on using structured threat intelligence to understand adversary behavior and improve detection and response within a SOC.

**Path:** SOC Level 1  
  
**Focus Area:** Threat Intelligence, Defensive Strategy
