# Systems as Attack Vectors

## Overview

This room explains how attackers exploit technical weaknesses in systems to gain access to environments. It focuses on common system-based attack vectors and how misconfigurations and vulnerabilities are abused.

**Path:** SOC Level 1

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Focus Area:** System Exploitation, Vulnerabilities, Attack Vectors



## What Was Covered

* System-based attack vectors
* Common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
* How attackers exploit exposed services
* Importance of patching and system hardening



## Key Points

* Systems are targeted through vulnerabilities and poor configurations
* Unpatched software increases attack surface
* Attackers often combine system and human-based techniques
* Defensive controls reduce exploitation risk



## Screenshots

Supporting screenshots for this room are stored in the [screenshots](screenshots) directory.



## Takeaways

Understanding system-based attack vectors helps SOC analysts:

* Recognize exploitation attempts
* Identify vulnerable systems during investigations
* Support remediation and hardening efforts
