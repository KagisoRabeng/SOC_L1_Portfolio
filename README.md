# SOC_L1_Portfolio
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through TryHackMe as I develop the skills required for a Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 role. It includes detailed write-ups, screenshots, investigation steps, and key takeaways from each room I complete. The goal is to demonstrate practical security analysis capabilities and track my progress as I build a strong SOC foundation.

## Focus Areas

- SOC Level 1 fundamentals
- Log analysis and alert triage
- SIEM operations
- Threat hunting and incident investigation
- Basic malware identification
- Network and endpoint security concepts

## Technologies & Tools

- SIEM platforms (various room-based tools)
- Linux command-line utilities
- Packet capture and analysis tools
- Sysinternals utilities
- Windows event log analysis
- Threat intelligence techniques

## TryHackMe Learning Path

This repository aligns with rooms commonly found in the following paths:

1. SOC Level 1
2. Introduction to Cybersecurity
3. Defensive Security
4. Cyber Defense Frameworks

I will add room links below as I complete them.
